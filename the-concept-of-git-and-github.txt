Concept of Git and GitHub

As for the concept of Git and GitHub; basically it allows groups of developers to collaborate on the same documents (often source code) simultaneously and without overriding each other’s work.
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them. However, Git is a free, open-source software distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to manage all source code history. It can keep a history of commits, can reverse changes, and lets developers share code. Each developer must have Git installed on his or her local device to collaborate
