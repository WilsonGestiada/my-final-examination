Git and Github have both numerous importance. The Git is a software that runs locally and it's the most commonly used version control system. It is a speedy and efficient distributed VCS tool that can handle projects of any size, from small to very large ones. 
With the use of Git, it provides cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. It also helps to track  the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done. In addition, it makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source that enables multiple developers or teams to work separately without having an impact on the work of others.
On the other hand, GitHub is a centralized platform. Centralized for developers all around the globe. A person can just host the repository created in Git to the whole world.  Using this, it increases the chances of better project development and in less time. GitHub provides you with the easiness of combining the changes and removes the headache of sharing the large code files. If GitHub is not there, you will face a series of challenges in order to work together as a team.
In essence, the Git and GitHub provides various benefits specially to the developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code without compromising the integrity of the original project.
